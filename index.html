    I'm currently a CS senior undergrad at <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">SJTU</a> (Shanghai Jiao Tong University) 
    equipped with a strong technique background.

    I do the development of <i>pragmatic</i> usage: kernels, servers, webpages, scientific computations, and etc.
    As for projects on hands, tremendously <i>distributed</i> datasets have also captured me, given its promising future regarding to the Informatic Industry.

<p>
    Inclusively, My academic fervor is now most located at the very region between the <i>Ubiquitous Computing + Artificial Intelligence</i>, including 
    its hallucinating applications that shape people's life in pace. I was lucky enough to get involved with lines of projects in this field at a 
    relatively young age (17, when I won the silver on the <a href="https://student.societyforscience.org/intel-isef">ISEF'12</a>), which labored me <a href="{{ site.data.navigation.Publications.url }}">a few publications</a> as well.
