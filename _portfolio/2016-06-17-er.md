ER is an app to avoid inattentive driving with **E**arly **R**ecognition, derived from my recent [work]({{ site.url }}/docs/INFOCOM_ER.pdf) on INFOCOM'17. In other words, it is perhaps the first app that can actually *prevent* inattentive drivings or other dangerous behaviors of certain patterns before they actually take place.

Contrary to previous works in which lights were shed on promoting detection accuracy, we instead focus on *how to use the least time to yield the most convincing warning*. Also, we challenged traditional method of vision-based solution and pre-deployed infrastructure because they are simply either computational-expensive or not light enough for propagation. To achieve these, our prospectives are basically threefold:

+ a sound-based-only sampling pipeline to extract raw patterns by Doppler shifts, which is robust to both posing place and environment noise.
+ a *Gradient Model Forest* inspired from DBN (Deep Belief Networks) yet not optimal for the task because of inadequate windowing length.
+ and an early recognition algorithm to yield the most likely result with as short period as possible.

Through extensive experiments with 8 volunteers driving for several months, ER can achieve an average total accuracy of 94.80% for inattentive driving recognition and recognize over 80% inattentive driving events before a specific event is 50% completed.
