[BeeksBeacon](http://github.com/cullengao/beeksbeacon) is a demo that I made for [GIoTTO](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/07/13/carnegie-mellon-to-lead-internet-of-things-expedition.aspx) project. It provides a way to accurately sharing and tuning beacons contextual information using *Bluvision Technology*, so as registering them onto Google cloud via its APIs.

In this project, global administration on beacons could be achieved by wrapping underlying differences between existing raw protocols (*sBeacon*, *iBeacon*, *Eddystone*, *AltBeacon*). Admin could first scan all beacons by moving around, then flow registering them onto customized server. All logistics and Geographical informations are updated every-time the smartphone entering beacon's advertising range. BeeksBeacon also allows users to communicate with each other not through server but only beacon by attach temporary data blob onto a specific beacon as a hop.

This project serves as a framework for further cooperation between *CMU* and *Google Co.* regarding to IoT infrastructure. Providers & Researchers could simply leverage this application to setup swift experimental environment, so as to extend existing configuration, given all beacons are treated from one base class blocking up bottom-end details.

Below shows the basic UI of the application itself:
