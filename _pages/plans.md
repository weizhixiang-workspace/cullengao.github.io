This page is a collection of learning plans I habitually kept for half a year.

Itâ€™s mostly the place for me to track the booklist / topics / predilections that I want to remember or check every now and then. I figured other people might find it handy too.

## Booklist
> Be a developer, not a code monkey.

+ *C++ Primer*: not gonna lie, but *C++* is definitely the language worth to be relearnt. Especially *C++ 17* features and advanced knacks, I found them compelling when recently skimming through [caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe)'s source code.
+ *Python Cookbook*: advanced Python. I always wonder how is it to realize relative import and OOP like a non-script language, maybe this short span before the grad school is a perfect timing. Integrated with [Hitchhiker's blog](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/).
+ *C Interfaces and Implementation*: for concise algorithm implementation, and, of course, interviews. Integrated with [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262033848_sch_0001.pdf).

## Topics
+ *DL*: there are basically three papers I wanna implement myself.
    - LSTM with CNN: "Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator". *CVPR'15*. [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf)
    - DCGAN - Generative model for new pictures: "Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convoluted Generative Adversarial Networks." *ICPR'16*. [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434v2.pdf)
    - 3DCNN - Dense Mapping: "3D Convolutional Neural Networks for Landing Zone Detection from LiDAR". *ICRA'15*. [[pdf]](http://www.dimatura.net/extra/3dcnn_lz_maturana_scherer_icra15.pdf)
+ *CG*: inspired from my colleague @[fengq](http://www.phonicavi.com/)
    - Shadow detection: "Shadow Detection and Sun Direction in Photo Collections." *3DV'15*. [[pdf]](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~shengbin/course/cg/Papers%20for%20Selection/Shadow%20Detection%20and%20Sun%20Direction%20in%20Photo%20Collections.pdf)
+ *UX*: context-aware computing to improve user experience.
    - Distributed database on smartphone's contexts: with Google Shanghai.

## Predilectinos
+ *Photography*: I finally set up my mind in shooting pro pictures, and just bought a *SONY DSC-RX100 M5*. Please keep tuning.
+ *Fingerstyle*: a little taste of heaven. Working on the piece of [Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIUi86_Hscw).
