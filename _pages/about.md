I'm **Hang**.

<center><img src="../images/about_me.jpg" height="42"></center><br>

Currently, I live in Shanghai, China. I'm expected in July, 2017 with a B.E. Degree of Information Security (IS) from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

Now, please allow me to introduce myself as a *learner*, a *developer* and an *observer.*

## Learner
If being good at coursework counts, I should be one of those so-called "skilled learner". Till the senior year, my major GPA is 3.85/4.0. I have never failed to rank top 3 in [my institution](http://infosec.sjtu.edu.cn/English.asp) out of 83 peers during the whole college phase. Yet I guess there should be more than that.

I start to learn programming from the junior high. At that time, I and my other two teammates participated in [*ISEF'12*](https://student.societyforscience.org/intel-isef) (the worldâ€™s largest international pre-college science competition) as a part of Chinese Delegation. We made our first project to estimate the submergence tolerant factors in rice genes and won a silver medal which was one of the best awards of China.

Through all these years, I have proceeded with a stable pace, from the curious high school kid to an independent researcher. I published three Engineer Indexed papers and submitted one about Early Recognition of inattentive driving events onto the top proceeding, [*INFOCOM'17*](http://infocom2017.ieee-infocom.org/). Please check [here]({{ site.url }}/publications) for more details.

Habitually, I here kept a [learning plan]({{ site.url }}/plans) of topics for next six coming months.

## Developer
This is the identity I've carried along for the most of time.

Equipped with a strong technique background, I push the development of *pragmatic* usage in OS kernels, servers, webpages, mobile apps, scientific computations, and etc. Consequently, I spent this summer in 2016 in [HCII@CMU](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/) as an Research Intern.

My current interest is located at the intersection of *Ubiquitous Computing & Artificial Intelligence*, basically about automation in self-driving car. Given my experiences extensively involved in this topic, I guess it might be the perfect match.

For the project on hands, tremendously *distributed* database have also captured me, given its promising future regarding to the Informatics Industry. An apology for not publishing this, given that it's a rather private co-work between our lab and [Google Shanghai](https://www.google.com/intl/sr/about/careers/locations/shanghai/).

A selective list of projects that I have worked on could be found in [Portfolio]({{ site.url }}/portfolio).

## Observer
Yep, one still in progress.

I intend to record tiny fragments of life, by photos and my own involvements.

Back to 2013, I spent two months as an international volunteer in Nepal via [VSN](http://volunteersocietynepal.org/) organization. My major task was to teach local kids about basic Mandarin and oral English. It was actually a life-time experience escaping from the metropolis and blend in with a culture way different from mine.

In 2014, I was designated as the president director of *We Met - 2018er welcoming gala* hosting for all freshmen to SJTU. This was one of the biggest campus affair of all year, taking up about three months for preparation. The phase was painstaking and full of obstacles, yet we made it through all the way till the opening of gala. It was totally worth it to see efforts being appreciated by all students and teachers.
