<br>
I'm **Hang**. I'm currently living in Shanghai, China. <br>
I do a lot of stuffs.

## Programming
I'm an expected senior student in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 
*Programmer* is what I mostly define myself and *Programming* is what I put the most energy on.

I do the development of *pragmatic* usage: kernels, servers, webpages, mobile apps, scientific computations, and etc. 
As for projects on hands, tremendously *distributed* datasets have also captured me, given its promising future regarding to the Informatics Industry.

A selective range of projects that I have worked on could be found in my *Portfolio*.

## Academics
As a undergrad, I've spent my high-grade time extensively in academical researching.
